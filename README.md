Project: Radix Hash Join Algorithm for join queries
In this project we implement join queries on a sample database
using the Radix Hash Join algorithm for fast and efficient execution.
This algorithm is based on a hash table for storing data, whose buckets
are smaller than the cache memory size. Also we apply multithreading for
additional speed and query re-ordering.
Implemented in C.
